The app was designed to address user needs for efficient inventory management with features such as secure login, CRUD operations for inventory items, and SMS notifications for critical updates. Its intuitive user interface included a login screen, a grid-view for displaying inventory, and simple navigation to ensure accessibility for all users. The coding process utilized incremental development, modular design, and continuous testing with the Android Emulator, ensuring a robust and error-free application. Thorough testing revealed and resolved issues like improper input validation and database persistence errors, highlighting the importance of debugging. A notable challenge was implementing SMS permissions in a user-friendly manner, which was resolved by transparently communicating the purpose of permissions and maintaining app functionality even when permissions were denied. Overall, the CRUD operations demonstrated strong database management skills, making the app both reliable and user-centered.
